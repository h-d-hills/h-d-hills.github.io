                <h2>web projects</h2>
                <p>I am, in a loose sense of the term, a front end web developer. here are some of the webpages I have made:</p>
            </span>
            <div id="gallery">
                <h3>simple layout</h3>
                <br>
                <a target='_blank' href="photo-gallery/index.html"><img src="images/photo.png" alt="photo gallery"></a>
                <p>this is a photo gallery project. it has a fairly simple layout, but it works. for this project, I familiarized myself with javascript plugins. images are highlighted as you mouse over them and expand when clicked. a search bar at the top allows you to search for specific images</p>
            </div>
            <div id="dashboard">
                <h3>complex layout</h3>
                <br>
                <a target='_blank' href="dashboard/index.html"><img src="images/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard layout"></a>
                <p>I don't know exactly how long this project took me. the days seemed to blend together and it felt like two weeks. however, I am very pleased with the result. I had to draw upon my knowledge of html, scss, javascript and svg images to pull this off. there are plenty of graphs, which are always good things to have</p>
            </div>
            <div id="game">
                <h3>web game</h3>
                <br>
                <a target='_blank' href="game-show/index.html"><img src="images/keyboard.png" alt="web game"></a>
                <p>for this project, I applied my understanding of javascript to developing a guessing game with a health system. the name of this game is Victory Big Success Time (Talking Heads Edition). Talking Heads is my favorite band of all time, so I saw it fitting to make this project about them. functionally this is identical to hangman, but stylistically it resembles a typing simulator</p>
            </div>
            <div id="employee">
                <h3>api implementation</h3>
                <br>
                <a target='_blank' href="employee-directory/index.html"><img src="images/person.png" alt="employee directory"></a>
                <p>this project is similar to the photo gallery project, except the data here are different every time you load the page. I used an online api to pull false user ids from an online fake people generator and displays the data in a user-friendly fashion</p>
