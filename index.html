                <h2>web projects</h2>
                <p>I am, in a loose sense of the term, a front end web developer. here are some of the webpages I have made:</p>
            </span>
            <div id="gallery">
                <h3>simple layout</h3>
                <br>
                <a target='_blank' href="photo-gallery/index.html"><img src="images/photo.png" alt="photo gallery"></a>
                <p>this is a photo gallery project. it has a fairly simple layout, but it works. images are highlighted as you mouse over them and expand when clicked. a search bar at the top allows you to search for specific images</p>
            </div>
            <div id="dashboard">
                <h3>complex layout</h3>
                <br>
                <a target='_blank' href="dashboard/index.html"><img src="images/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard layout"></a>
                <p>I don't know exactly how long this project took me. the days seemed to blend together and it felt like two weeks. however, I am very pleased with the result. there are plenty of graphs, which are always good things to have</p>
            </div>
            <div id="game">
                <h3>web game</h3>
                <br>
                <a target='_blank' href="game-show/index.html"><img src="images/keyboard.png" alt="web game"></a>
                <p>this is a web game called Victory Big Success Time (Talking Heads Edition). Talking Heads is my favorite band of all time, so I saw it fitting to make this project about them. functionally this is identical to hangman, but stylistically it resembles a typing simulator</p>
            </div>
            <div id="employee">
                <h3>api implementation</h3>
                <br>
                <a target='_blank' href="employee-directory/index.html"><img src="images/person.png" alt="employee directory"></a>
                <p>this project is similar to the photo gallery project, except the data here are different every time you load the page. this uses an api to  pull false user ids from an online fake people generator and displays the data in a user-friendly fashion</p>
